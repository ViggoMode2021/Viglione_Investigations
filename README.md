# Viglione_Investigations

This is a no frills website that will be updated periodically for my father, Salvatore Viglione and his excellent PI business. My father was paying too much for
some other company to make him a website and host it. However, this company managed to leave a plethora of spelling and formatting errors. I, however, was not going to 
stand for that. This website has no spelling errors and all accurate information. It may not have loads of unnecessary Javascript, but it serves its purpose. This website was developed with Django. Stay tuned for the updated domain.
